"""
This module offers standardized methods of loading commonly used data sets.

Each data set, when loaded, returns a tuple of :code:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader` objects:

* The training loader, which contains batches of data that can be used for training (e.g. standard or adversarial training).
* The validation loader, which contains batches of data to be used during training procedures to prevent overfitting and perform other optimizations.
* The test loader, which contains batches of test data to be used after training is complete.

These three sets are disjoint and randomly split according to the supplied :code:`seed`.

Note that most machine learning data sets do not have a standardized validation set.
Whenever this is the case, validation data will be obtained by randomly splitting off 20% of the training set.
The test set is never mixed with the other sets in order to maintain compatibility with external evaluations.
